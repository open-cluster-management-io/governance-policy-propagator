                  CopyPolicyMetadata specifies whether the labels and annotations of a policy should be copied
                  when replicating the policy to a managed cluster. If set to "true", all of the labels and
                  annotations of the policy are copied to the replicated policy. If set to "false", only the
                  policy framework-specific policy labels and annotations are copied to the replicated policy.
                  This setting is useful if there is tracking for metadata that should only exist on the root
                  policy. It is recommended to set this to "false" when using Argo CD to deploy the policy
                  definition since Argo CD uses metadata for tracking that should not be replicated. The default
                  value is "true".
