# Governance Policy Propagator [![KinD tests](https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/governance-policy-propagator/actions/workflows/kind.yml/badge.svg?branch=main&event=push)](https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/governance-policy-propagator/actions/workflows/kind.yml)[![License](https://img.shields.io/:license-apache-blue.svg)](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html)

## Description

The governance policy propagator is a controller that watches `Policies`, `PlacementBindings`, and `PlacementRules`. It manages replicated Policies in cluster namespaces based on the PlacementBindings and PlacementRules, and it updates the status on Policies to show aggregated cluster compliance results. This controller is a part of the [governance-policy-framework](https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/governance-policy-framework).

The operator watches for changes to trigger a reconcile:

1. Changes to Policies in non-cluster namespaces trigger a self reconcile.
2. Changes to Policies in cluster namespaces trigger a root Policy reconcile.
2. Changes to PlacementBindings trigger reconciles on the subject Policies. 
3. Changes to PlacementRules trigger reconciles on subject Policies.

Every reconcile does the following:

1. Creates/updates/deletes replicated policies in cluster namespaces based on PlacementBinding/PlacementRule results.
2. Creates/updates/deletes the policy status to show aggregated cluster compliance results.
